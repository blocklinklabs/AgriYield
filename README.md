# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

*   `npx hardhat help` - Displays a list of available Hardhat tasks.
*   `npx hardhat test` - Executes the project's tests.
*   `REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test` - Runs tests and generates a gas usage report.
*   `npx hardhat node` - Starts a local Hardhat Network node for development.
*   `npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts` - Deploys the Lock contract using Hardhat Ignition.
