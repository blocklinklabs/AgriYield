## üåç The Story Behind ZaraHarvest

### Meet Kwame

Kwame Asante wakes up at 4 AM every day on his 2-acre maize farm in Kumasi, Ghana. For 15 years, he's been farming the same way his father taught him‚Äîplanting when the rains come, harvesting when the crops look ready, and hoping for the best.

Last season, Kwame lost half his crop to unexpected heavy rains. The middleman who buys his maize paid him 30% less than market price, claiming "quality issues." When Kwame tried to get a loan to buy better seeds for next season, the bank laughed. "No collateral, no loan," they said.

Kwame's story isn't unique. It's the story of millions of African farmers.

### The Problem

While corporate farms use satellite weather data, AI predictions, and blockchain contracts, smallholder farmers like Kwame are still farming in the dark:

- **They guess when to plant** because weather forecasts don't reach rural areas
- **They lose crops** to weather they never saw coming
- **They get ripped off** by middlemen who control market access
- **They can't get credit** because banks don't understand farming
- **They have no data** to make better decisions

### Our Solution

**ZaraHarvest** changes this story.

We built a platform that gives farmers like Kwame the same tools that corporate farms use‚Äîbut designed specifically for African smallholders. Real weather data on their phones. AI predictions for their specific crops. Direct market access without middlemen. Credit backed by their harvest, not their land.

Today, Kwame uses ZaraHarvest to check weather alerts, get yield predictions, and access credit when he needs it. His maize yield increased by 20% last season. He's planning to expand his farm.

This is the story we want to tell‚Äînot about disrupting tradition, but about giving farmers the tools they need to succeed.
